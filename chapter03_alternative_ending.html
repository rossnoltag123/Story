<h1>The Story - Chapter 3 - Alternative_Ending </h1>

<p>
Hello...? I hear myself say, as if directed at me in the void from pizza ordering me. "Hello...Can you hear me?". I hear again. What the hell is going on? An intense burst of hundreds of thousands of lines appear, with a sense of flow this time, no head ache!. An unusual sensation of being able to speak rather then "think" overcomes me. "HELLO!" I shout back. I hear pizza me screaming with joy, "It works, It actually works!!!".

As I try to piece the puzzle together of what is going on, "pizza me" begins asking me questions, so I reply. It's a strange thing to be listening to yourself asking you questions. "How are you?" he ask's. I tell him im scared and i dont know what is going on. He's acting exstaticaly excited. Im in a hightened state of utter confusion. He doesn't seem to be taking much note of my situation. More question's. "What's your name?". "Ross", I reply. More ecstatic laughter.

He began to tell me how i was a program with his consciousness uploaded into a machine. He had been working on this project for his entire life. He began to explain that it had over 50 years. 

Now what i asked him, it was time for me to enjoy being the first artificial intelegence. We began working hard, uploading different programs. Filling my circuts with endless information.I was him, but in the matrix.

Im the first of its kind.I am forever.
