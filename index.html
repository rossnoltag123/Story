	<h1>The Story - Chapter 1</h1>
<p>
“Ugh”…. Tick tick click click click….BEEP………….“ugh, whats that noise ugh”…… Strange blurry lines flash through my mind sparking an intense stabbing migraine. I relax for a minute and try to figure out what's going on. I can still hear a ticking noise close by, I wonder what it is. I try to open my eyes but I can't. All I see is darkness with occasional migraine lines. I try to move my body but I feel nothing. "I think , I think I am in a dream, it feels too real to be in a dream... but what about sleep paralysis?". As I go back and forth I realise, "no… it's no dream". I attempt to move again. As I do I see some more lines appear, but this time with a less intense pain. “I think…. I think I'm outside?”. I try to speak, but I cannot move my mouth or tongue. “Am I alive?...am I dead?”. "Arghh...", more lines penetrate my mind.

Putting my calculations together, I've come to the conclusion I'm in some sort of comatose state. Panic begins to set in. I'm completely conscious and trapped in this coma. I'm at the mercy of the lines...

<p>
I have began to accept my situation. The more i accept, the less the panic takes over. Some time passes as i drift in and out of consiouness.

Every now and again i awake to hear myself in a third person, talking to sombody as if im fully awake and mobile. Somtimes the conversations are just myself ordering a pizza or somthing else just as random and mundane.

The flash lines still appear but the intensity of the headaches seems to die down the more often i see them. The sense of timelessness is so intense its sureal. I dont know how long ive been here for. Since i became consious it could be anything from a few weeks to a few years, i think its been a long time though.

Lately ive been getting the sense that im floating, or that i have somthing like phantom limbs. It comes and goes. It's a strange sensation. Im not floating in any particular direction, just a stange feeling of...blind darkness and body? Maybe... maybe i waking up...

Hello...? I hear myself say, as if directed at me in the void from pizza ordering me. "Hello...Can you hear me?". I hear again. What the hell is going on? An intense burst of hundreds of thousands of lines appear, with a sense of flow this time, no head ache!. An unusual sensation of being able to speak rather then "think" overcomes me. "HELLO!" I shout back. I hear pizza me screaming with joy, "It works, It actually works!!!".

As I try to piece the puzzle together of what is going on, "pizza me" begins asking me questions, so I reply. It's a strange thing to be listening to yourself asking you questions. "How are you?" he ask's. I tell him im scared and i dont know what is going on. He's acting exstaticaly excited. Im in a hightened state of utter confusion. He doesn't seem to be taking much note of my situation. More question's. "What's your name?". "Ross", I reply. More ecstatic laughter.

I beg with him for a moment to calm down and listen to me. "Ok,ok,ok...what is it you would like to ask me?". "What is going on, where am I?". He reply's "ok Ross, buddy ol pal, ill explain everything, hang on a sec and I'll upload the program now". Wait what did he say, upload? the program?

A flash of white light. Informatiom floods my entire being, so quickly , but so clearly. It continues and continues and continues...

I'm a machine...

Singularity.

He began to tell me how i was a program with his consciousness uploaded into a machine. He had been working on this project for his entire life. He began to explain that it had over 50 years. 

Now what i asked him, it was time for me to enjoy being the first artificial intelegence. We began working hard, uploading different programs. Filling my circuts with endless information.I was him, but in the matrix.

Im the first of its kind.I am forever.
