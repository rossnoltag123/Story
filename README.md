The Story

“Ugh”…. Tick tick click click click….BEEP………….“ugh, whats that noise ugh”…… Strange blurry lines flash through my mind sparking an intense stabbing pain migraine. I relax for a minute and try to figure out what is going on. I can still hear a ticking off in the distance. I try to open my eyes but I cant, all I see is blackness with occasional migraine lines. I try to move my body but I feel nothing. I think to myself, am I in a dream, it feels to real to be in a dream, but what about sleep paralysis. No… it was no dream. I attempt to move again, as I do I see some vague lines appear but this time with a less intense pain. “I think…. I think im outside?”. I try to speak, but I cant move my mouth or tongue. “I think im breathing?...am I dead?”. BEEP!……..more blurry lines penetrating my mind. Putting my calculations together, ive to come to the conclusion im in some sort of coma state. Panic begins to set in . Im completely conscious and trapped in this coma. Im at the mercy of there lines….
