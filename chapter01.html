<h1>The Story - Chapter 1</h1>

<p>
“Ugh”…. Tick tick click click click….BEEP………….“ugh, whats that noise ugh”…… Strange blurry lines flash through my mind sparking an intense stabbing migraine. I relax for a minute and try to figure out what's going on. I can still hear a ticking noise close by, I wonder what it is. I try to open my eyes but I can't. All I see is darkness with occasional migraine lines. I try to move my body but I feel nothing. "I think , I think I am in a dream, it feels too real to be in a dream... but what about sleep paralysis?". As I go back and forth I realise, "no… it's no dream". I attempt to move again. As I do I see some more lines appear, but this time with a less intense pain. “I think…. I think I'm outside?”. I try to speak, but I cannot move my mouth or tongue. “Am I alive?...am I dead?”. "Arghh...", more lines penetrate my mind.

Putting my calculations together, I've come to the conclusion I'm in some sort of comatose state. Panic begins to set in. I'm completely conscious and trapped in this coma. I'm at the mercy of the lines...
