<h1>The Story - Chapter 3</h1>

<p>

Hello...? I hear myself say, as if directed at me in the void from pizza ordering me. "Hello...Can you hear me?". I hear again. What the hell is going on? An intense burst of hundreds of thousands of lines appear, with a sense of flow this time, no head ache!. An unusual sensation of being able to speak rather then "think" overcomes me. "HELLO!" I shout back. I hear pizza me screaming with joy, "It works, It actually works!!!".

As I try to piece the puzzle together of what is going on, "pizza me" begins asking me questions, so I reply. It's a strange thing to be listening to yourself asking you questions. "How are you?" he ask's. I tell him im scared and i dont know what is going on. He's acting exstaticaly excited. Im in a hightened state of utter confusion. He doesn't seem to be taking much note of my situation. More question's. "What's your name?". "Ross", I reply. More ecstatic laughter.

I beg with him for a moment to calm down and listen to me. "Ok,ok,ok...what is it you would like to ask me?". "What is going on, where am I?". He reply's "ok Ross, buddy ol pal, ill explain everything, hang on a sec and I'll upload the program now". Wait what did he say, upload? the program?

A flash of white light. Informatiom floods my entire being, so quickly , but so clearly. It continues and continues and continues...

I'm a machine...

Singularity.
