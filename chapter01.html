The Story

“Ugh”…. Tick tick click click click….BEEP………….“ugh, whats that noise ugh”…… Strange blurry lines flash through my mind sparking an intense stabbing migraine. I relax for a minute and try to figure out what is going on. I can still hear a ticking noise close by, I wonder what it is. I try to open my eyes but I cant, all I see is blackness with occasional migraine lines. I try to move my body but I feel nothing. "I think , I think I am in a dream, it feels to real to be in a dream, but what about sleep paralysis". As i go back and forth i realise, no… it was no dream. I attempt to move again, as I do I see some lines appear, but this time with a less intense pain. “I think…. I think im outside?”. I try to speak, but I cant move my mouth or tongue. “Am I alive?...am I dead?”. "Aghh...", more lines penetrate my mind. Putting my calculations together, ive come to the conclusion im in some sort of coma state. Panic begins to set in. Im completely conscious and trapped in this coma. Im at the mercy of the lines….
