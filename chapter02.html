<h1>The Story - Chapter 2</h1>

<p>
I have began to accept my situation. The more i accept, the less the panic takes over. Some time passes as i drift in and out of consiouness.

Every now and again i awake to hear myself in a third person, talking to sombody as if im fully awake and mobile. Somtimes the conversations are just myself ordering a pizza or somthing else just as random and mundane.

The flash lines still appear but the intensity of the headaches seems to die down the more often i see them. The sense of timelessness is so intense its sureal. I dont know how long ive been here for. Since i became consious it could be anything from a few weeks to a few years, i think its been a long time.

Lately ive been getting the sense that im floating, or that i have phantom limbs. It comes and goes. Its a strange sensation. Im not floating in any particular direction, just a stange feeling of body... maybe i waking up...
